The site incorporates modern design elements and interactive features to enhance the user experience.
## **Features**
### **1. Christmas Special Countdown**
- A dynamic JavaScript-powered countdown timer is displayed prominently on the homepage.
- **How it Works**:
  - The countdown timer calculates the remaining time until the start of the **Orange Restaurant's Christmas Special**.
  - The timer dynamically updates in real time, showing days, hours, minutes, and seconds left.
  - Once the countdown reaches zero, a festive message is displayed to users, creating excitement for the special promotion.
### **2. Search Button with Dynamic Search Box**
- A search icon in the navigation bar allows users to search the website easily.
- **How it Works**:
