## **Features**  

### **1. Valentine Special Countdown**  
This feature displays a dynamic countdown timer on the homepage, counting down to the restaurant's Valentine Special event.  

**How it Works:**  
- The JavaScript function calculates the time difference between the current date and Christmas.  
- It dynamically updates every second, displaying the remaining **days, hours, minutes, and seconds**.  
- Once the countdown reaches zero, it displays a special message instead of the timer.

### **2. Search Button with Dynamic Search Box ðŸ”Ž**  
A search icon in the navigation bar allows users to perform searches efficiently without cluttering the UI.  

**ðŸ”¹ How it Works:**  
- The search box is hidden by default and only appears when the user clicks the **search icon**.  
- If the user clicks outside the search area, the box automatically disappears to maintain a clean interface.  
- JavaScript handles these interactions, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience.

### **3. Check Availability Form**  
This section allows users to check the availability of different event categories at the restaurant, including **Wedding & Events, Conferencing, and The Mandarin Room**.  

**How it Works:**  
- The form includes fields for selecting a category, check-in and check-out dates, and event start and end times.  
- JavaScript ensures that all fields are filled in before submitting.  
- If the form is incomplete, an alert notifies the user.  
- Once submitted, the selected details are displayed in an alert, and this data can be sent to a backend for further processing.

### **Proper Image Viewing**
The website ensures an optimal image viewing experience for users browsing the restaurant gallery.

**How it Works:**

Images are displayed in a responsive grid layout for seamless adaptation across different screen sizes.
Clicking on an image expands it for a closer view.
Users can navigate between images using an interactive gallery or lightbox effect for a smooth experience.
