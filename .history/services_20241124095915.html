                Above and beyond the most spectacular view over the city and its surrounding valleys, we take pride in our immaculate service, our fine selection of wines and modern cuisine, suitable to just about any palate. We offer an exclusivity that is rare to the area, and therefore, we endeavor to keep the weddings held at the restaurant exclusive too. Conveniently, you can have both the ceremony and reception at the restaurant, as well as have your guests stay over at the guest house which shares the same premises as the restaurant.
